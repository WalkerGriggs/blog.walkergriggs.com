# [walkergriggs.com](https://walkergriggs.com) -- my personal website and blog

I'm not a web developer, and this site has gone through about 8 different revisions in the last 3 years. For now... we're happy with it.

The website itself is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The content is written in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [Orgmode](https://orgmode.org/) and exported with [Ox-Hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/)

## Quick start

```
hugo serve -D
```
