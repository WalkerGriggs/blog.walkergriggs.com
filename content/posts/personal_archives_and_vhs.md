A colleague of mind recently bought a capture card to record game play footage. Naturally, I asked if they wanted to stream on Twitch or post videos to Youtube. "No", he said, "I just like the idea of saving the recordings for a personal archive; just to have."

He explained that, at one time, he had a Youtube channel he'd post to regularly. In fact, they were quite proud of the content. Since then, they've deleted the channel and the contents along with it which they regret in hindsight.

How could you not be bummed?

I have a similar experience. I had a Youtube channel sometime around 2011 and posted silly video game content. I wasn't any good at the games, but I deeply enjoyed something about the the content creation, curation, and narration. In some ways, the channel felt like contribution to the greater larger gaming community.

You can imagine my disappointment when someone commented: "your videos are fantastic, if only you started 3 years ago". Looking back, that comment is hilariously short sighed. Youtube and the esports world was in its infancy in 2011, and it still is in many ways. But, for whatever reason, I chose to believe this internet stranger.

I'm sure part of me was embarrassed by the content. Part of me also felt there was ego in posting content. Those same feeling perked up again two years ago when I tried streaming programming on Twitch. I ultimately stopped because I was short on time and it was pretty stressful, to be frank. Throughout those 4 or so months, though, I felt that the content I was creating was self-centered.

"You have to truly believe other people want to hear what you have to say", I would tell myself. In the moment, I chalked that feeling up to impostor syndrome; that's a safe be these days. After spending some time those emotions those, I found that they stemmed from a place of insincerity. I wanted to create content, not because I thing I'm a tremendous creator and entertainer, but because I envied the folks who were.

## Spicy P and the Handycam Vision {#spicy-p-and-the-handycam-vision}

Let's tie up some loose strings before this derails into a diary post. During that conversing my colleague highlight an imortant distinction -- the line between content created for personal versus content uploaded for public consumption. There's something inherently genuine and intimate iwth content created just for yourself or your close group of friend. There's no ego, there is only enthusiasm. That's what, paradoxicaly, makes it more intriguing to the outsider.

My colleague went on to tell me the story of Pascal Siakam, an NBA player currently signed with the Toronto Raptors, who showed up the NBA All-Star game with an array of cam quarters -- some digital and some tape. People were <span class="underline">throwing</span> themselves at the camera. In sea of cellphone cameras and production broadcast equipment, everyone wanted to be taped by Spicy P and his Handycam Vision.

It was such a sincere act. His smiles were genuine, and everyone's reaction was priceless. He posted clips to Instagram after. The film was so grainy and the colors fluctuated and realtime that it couldn't be use for anything <span class="underline">but</span> personal records. I love that idea.

## Alfs Room {#alfs-room}

Siakam's story reminds me so much of Adachi Yoshinori's website [Alf's Room](https://alf-s-room.com/) after Nick Robinson's video [The mystery of MICHAELSOFT BINBOWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDzAAjzbV5g). Yoshinori created Alf's Room in '96 to document hobbies and curiosities. And I mean that literally, some of the pages are just internal dialog on the strange things he finds around Japan like t-shaped vending machines and holiday lights at train stations.

This website isn't some Squarespace-special. It's been hand crafted for years with no target audience in mind except himself. It's a digital diary that just so happens to be publicly accessible and is poster child of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).
