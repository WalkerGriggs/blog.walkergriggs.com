**Hi, my name is Walker Griggs, and I reboot your servers.**

</div>

I'm an infrastructure and software engineer living in San Francisco, focusing on public cloud technologies and distributed systems.

I'm passionate about bleeding edge technology that powers and transforms our day to day, my educational background is in Computer Science and English, and I'm curious about every aspect of full-stack development.

Outside of the office, I enjoy tinerking with Linux, riding my bike, and playing far too much chess.

## What {#what}

Aside from being my personal website, this site hosts my thoughts -- young, old, ill-informed, and carefully considered.

Every word on this site is generated from an Emacs Org file, renered by Hugo, and hosted on Github.

Of course, the opinions here are my own, not of my employer.
