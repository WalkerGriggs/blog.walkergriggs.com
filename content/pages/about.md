**Hi, my name is Walker Griggs, and I reboot your servers.**

</div>

I'm an infrastructure and software engineer working at [Heroku](https://heroku.com), living in San Francisco, and focusing on public cloud technologies and distributed systems.

My educational background is in Computer Science and English, and I'm passionate about the hidden technologies that silently transform our day to day. Outside of the office, I enjoy puzzling, riding my bike, writing occasionally, and playing far too much chess.

Aside from being my personal website, this site hosts my thoughts -- young, old, ill-informed, and carefully considered. Every word on this site is generated from an Emacs Org file, renered by Hugo, and hosted on Github.

Of course, the opinions here are my own, not of my employer.
