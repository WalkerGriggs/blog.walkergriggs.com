**Hi, my name is Walker Griggs, and I reboot your servers.**

</div>

I'm a systems engineer based in San Francisco, focused on the hidden technology that subtly transforms our day to day. I'm currently working at [Mux](<https://mux.com>), and previously was at [Heroku](<https://heroku.com>).

This site hosts my thoughts -- young, old, ill-informed, and carefully considered. Of course, the opinions here are my own, not of my employer.
