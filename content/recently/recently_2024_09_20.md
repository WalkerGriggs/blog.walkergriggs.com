I've always enjoyed [Mac Wright's 'Recently' posts](https://macwright.com/2024/08/01/recently.html). They remind me of a modern, retrospective reinterpretation of [John Carmack's .plan files](https://github.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive). I've always kept my Claptrap (IYKYK) so "recently" pages feel like a good way to hold myself accountable. Or at least, to attempt to.
